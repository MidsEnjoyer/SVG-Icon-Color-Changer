🎨 SVG Icon Color Changer
A modern, lightweight Windows 11 utility built with Python and CustomTkinter. This tool allows you to batch-recolor thousands of SVG icons in seconds while maintaining a clean, native OS aesthetic.

🚀 Key Features
Massive Batch Processing: Handle thousands of files at once without the app freezing.

Modern UI/UX: Fully responsive design with native Dark and Light mode support.

Smart Attribute Detection: Automatically identifies and replaces both fill and stroke hex codes within SVG XML.

Portable Executable: Use the standalone .exe without needing to install Python or libraries.

💥 Why?
I downloaded all of the Tabler Icons and wanted to make them different colors!
